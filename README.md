A modular Telegram Python bot running on python3 with a sqlalchemy database.

Originally a SaitamaRobot fork, Saitama evolved further and was built to be more robust and more dedicated to Anime Chats. 

Can be found on telegram as.


## Credits
The bot is based on the original work done by [PaulSonOfLars](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars)
This repo was just revamped to suit an Anime-centric community. All original credits go to Paul and his dedication, Without his efforts, this fork would not have been possible!

Also, missing proper credit for blacklistusers taken from TheRealPhoenixBot (will add it later, this note says unless it is done)

Any other authorship/credits can be seen through the commits.
